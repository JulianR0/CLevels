## v4.02

- Fixed handicap menu inserting new lines when activating handicaps.
- Fixed "Dirty Mag" handicap consuming akimbo uzi ammo -twice- during reload.

## v4.00

- Reworked save system, this new system should be much more efficient with increase server perfomance. Old v3.73 save files are compatible with this update, migration should be done automatically with no issues.
- 3 new achievements have been added.
- Removed ENABLE_FF, ALLOW_PVP_SCORE and Friendly Fire handicap. This was a terrible idea.
- New "Dirty Mag" handicap - Any ammo left unused on the magazine is lost in the next reload.
- New map settings: SIMULATED_LEVEL, NO_SAVE and LIMITED_RESPAWN.
- Server admins can now force handicaps to players via console.
- Server owners can now enable/disable skills, overpower, data saving, or start simulation mode directly, at any time, on any map via console.
- Some obscure bug fixes that I no longer remember.

## v3.XX

- Check the "v3" branch for older changelogs.
